In all the 3 test files the Initialization of the driver was not in place
Adjusted the driver that was never returned

Started with the SingInTest
* Found that it was not able to click on the SignIn Button.
* Initial analysis showed that this button was in another frame.
* Later tried switching the frame, was able to identify the frame, but it was not switching.
* Did some google and after long hour, found out that it could be because of driver version.
* Later replaced the ChromeDriver to the version the browser that i'm using
* Now i was able to click the SignIn Button and was able to fix the SignInTest

Improvement Suggestion:
* We can remove the Object to the specific page and avoid having them in the Test Class
* Similarly we can avoid having the Drive initialization from Test Class and move it to some Base class
* We can have the Object class created separately
* We can create separate helper class to bring in all the helper methods such as waitFor, isElementPresent for reusability
* Also we can have the selenium window functions also in separate utility class for reusability

Implemented Suggestions:
* Created a new PageObject class for SignIn
* Used design pattern Page Object model for the test cases design

Further Improvements:
* Will create separate utility class for comparing the actual and expected values
* Will create utility for Window functions

Implemented Suggestions:
* Moved the Driver path and initialization in separate Base class
* Renamed the method as setUpDriver instead of setUpDriverPath

Improvement Suggestions:
* For now we can see the browser is always Chrome, we can parameterize and have a switch statement to have multiple browsers that we can use

Implemented Suggestions:
* Created a base test class which initiates the driver and also created method for launching web application
* Refractored the SignInTest class and inherited the base test, now this can be reused across all the test classes

Started with FlightBookingTest class file
* Tried to first check the existing tests
* There was a typo for the id of the To text field.
* Also there is a flaw of using the explicit wait. Sometimes the dropdown element value may pop wup within the explicit wait but sometimes it does not.
* Unimplemented method inititalizeDriver() was present
* Element is used more than once, but also identified with locators more than once. This is not required. We can reuse the element that is identified
* We are doing the assertion but not verifying that the search summary has the Source and Destination that we are looking for

Improvement Suggestion:
* Adjust the locators, can be moved to Page class as we did in SignInPage. So that we can reuse the element
* Create an implicit wait, so that we can have the stable test

Implemented Suggestion:
* Created a new Page class FlightBookingPage and moved all the locators here.
* Moved the test stepa\actions from FlightBookingTest to a parameterized method in FlightBookingPage, so that user can pass the source and destination from Test. 
* Changed the assertion to check the search summary has the correct results
* Implemented the wait utility which we can reuse.
* Refactor'd the FlightBookingTest class by using the method from Page class
