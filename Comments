In all the 3 test files the Initialization of the driver was not in place
Adjusted the driver that was never returned

Started with the SingInTest
* Found that it was not able to click on the SignIn Button.
* Initial analysis showed that this button was in another frame.
* Later tried switching the frame, was able to identify the frame, but it was not switching.
* Did some google and after long hour, found out that it could be because of driver version.
* Later replaced the ChromeDriver to the version the browser that i'm using
* Now i was able to click the SignIn Button and was able to fix the SignInTest
